## üöÄ Vercel Deployment

This project is now configured for secure deployment on Vercel with proper API key protection.

### Project Structure
- `public/index.html`, `public/style.css`, `public/hand.js` ‚Äì Frontend files
- `api/generate.js` ‚Äì Serverless function that securely calls Hugging Face API
- `vercel.json` ‚Äì Deployment configuration

### Deploy to Vercel
1. Import this repository on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Add environment variable:
   - **Key**: `HF_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Your Hugging Face API key (starts with `hf_...`)
   - **Location**: Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
3. Deploy!

### Security Features
- ‚úÖ API key is stored securely as an environment variable
- ‚úÖ Frontend calls `/api/generate` (serverless function) instead of directly calling Hugging Face
- ‚úÖ No sensitive data exposed in browser
- ‚úÖ Same-origin requests prevent CORS issues

### How It Works
1. Frontend sends POST to `/api/generate` with `{ model, inputs, parameters, options }`
2. Serverless function forwards request to Hugging Face with secure API key
3. Image blob is returned to the client for display/download
